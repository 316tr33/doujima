            The Shikoku Pilgrimage is a journey visiting 88 temples associated with Kobo Daishi (Kukai) in Shikoku. This pilgrimage route, spanning approximately 1,400km in total, has been walked by many people since ancient times as a journey to face oneself and promote spiritual growth.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The minimum necessary items include a seal book (nokyo-cho), white robe (byaku-e), sedge hat (suge-gasa), and walking stick (kongo-zue). These "pilgrimage supplies" can be obtained at Ryozenji Temple (the first temple) or through online shopping. For walking pilgrims, comfortable shoes, appropriate clothing, and rain gear are also important preparations.

          <p>
            The cost varies greatly depending on the method of pilgrimage (walking, car, bus tour, etc.), number of days, and accommodation grade. For walking pilgrims, the estimate is around 5,000-10,000 yen per day. This includes accommodation, meals, and temple seal fees.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Walking pilgrimage offers the charm of deeply facing oneself step by step, experiencing nature's beauty and interactions with local people. Car pilgrimage, on the other hand, allows those with time or physical constraints to make the journey more easily. Either method shows the same devotion to Kobo Daishi.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Yes, many women travel alone on the pilgrimage. Shikoku has a deep-rooted culture of "osettai" (hospitality), and local people warmly watch over pilgrims. However, please take basic safety precautions such as avoiding solo activities at night and carefully managing valuables.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            It's not necessary to visit in numerical order. While visiting in order is called "jun-uchi," there are various methods like "gyaku-uchi" (reverse order from 88), "kugiri-uchi" (visiting in sections), and "ikkoku-mairi" (visiting one prefecture's temples only). You can freely plan according to your physical strength and available time.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            You don't need to prepare everything from the start. Begin with the minimum necessities for worship like seal book, prayer beads, incense, and candles. Items like white robes and walking sticks can be purchased as you feel the need during your pilgrimage. They are available at Ryozenji Temple (first temple), temple shops, or online stores.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Generally, the "Heart Sutra" is recited at both the main hall and Daishi hall. There is also a service order including opening verse, repentance, honzon mantra, komyo mantra, and sacred name. You don't need to memorize everything; reading from a sutra book is fine. If time is limited, reciting the Heart Sutra with sincere devotion is considered sufficient.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Temple seals (goshuin) are received as proof of completing your worship. Therefore, the proper etiquette is to first worship at the main hall and Daishi hall, then go to the seal office. However, during crowded times, temples may instruct you to submit your book first, so please follow their instructions.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Yes, the basic order is to first worship at the main hall where the principal deity is enshrined, then proceed to the Daishi hall where Kobo Daishi is enshrined. This represents the feeling of greeting the principal deity first, then greeting Kobo Daishi.

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Taking name slips from the offering box without permission is considered bad manners. These slips were offered by other pilgrims and contain their thoughts and karma. Colored slips (brocade, gold, silver) should be received directly as osettai from experienced pilgrims or taken only when placed with temple permission "for those with connection."

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Yes, there are basic rules. First, place a candle on the stand, then light incense from that flame and place it in the incense burner. Generally, at both the main hall and Daishi hall, offer one candle and three incense sticks each. The three incense sticks represent honoring the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha) or purifying the Three Poisons (greed, anger, ignorance).

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The walking staff is considered an incarnation of Kobo Daishi. According to legend, Kobo Daishi once slept under a bridge, so tapping the staff on a bridge would disturb his rest. Therefore, it is proper etiquette not to tap the staff on bridges.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Nokyo (temple stamps) are mainly composed of three types of stamps: "temple stamp," "treasure stamp," and "temple seal," along with brush-written calligraphy. Generally, the temple stamp showing "Shikoku No. X" is written on the upper right, Sanskrit characters representing the principal deity and treasure stamp in the center, and the temple name on the left. Characters such as "Hono" (offering) and "Hohai" (respectful worship) represent the meaning of offering sutras or worshiping respectfully.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            There is no mandatory requirement, but it is common to make a thanksgiving visit to report the completion (kechigan) and express gratitude. Well-known locations for thanksgiving visits include Ryozenji Temple (Temple 1) where the pilgrimage began, and Okunoin at Koyasan where Kobo Daishi's mausoleum is located. You should visit at a time that is convenient for you.

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            "Dogyo Ninin" is a phrase meaning "Kobo Daishi (Kukai) is always with you." Even when pilgrims are traveling alone, they believe that Kobo Daishi is watching over and supporting them. Therefore, "Dogyo Ninin" is written on the sedge hat and white clothing to express the faith that they are traveling together with Kobo Daishi.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The upper part of the kongotsue is shaped like a sotoba (wooden grave marker) to serve as a gravestone if one dies during the pilgrimage. Therefore, it is considered good to hide that sotoba part while alive, and covering it has the meaning of protecting this sacred part. It also serves as a marker to distinguish it from other people's staffs.

            Consumables such as candles, incense, and name slips are sold at most temples, but many temples do not carry white clothing or sedge hats.

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Generally, after arriving at a temple and passing through the main gate, ring the bell quietly once before worship. This has the meaning of greeting the Buddha, saying "I am now going to worship." Ringing the bell after worship is called "modori-gane" (return bell) and is considered unlucky, so it should be avoided. Some temples prohibit ringing the bell, so please follow the guidance in such cases.

            Osettai is a custom where local people provide pilgrims with food, drinks, rest areas, and other services free of charge. Hosting pilgrims is considered to have the same meaning as hosting Kobo Daishi himself, and is a culture of pure kindness that seeks no reward in return. When you receive osettai, it is considered proper etiquette to offer a name slip (osame-fuda) with gratitude.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The miei (sacred images) given at each temple are sacred items considered to be manifestations of the principal deity. They are given together when you receive nokyo. Store them carefully in a dedicated "miei-cho" (sacred image book) or "miei preservation book," and after completing the pilgrimage, it is common to make them into hanging scrolls or frames and enshrine them in the tokonoma (alcove) or Buddhist altar. Never handle them carelessly.

            "Reverse pilgrimage" (gyaku-uchi) means visiting the 88 temples of Shikoku in reverse order, from temple 88 to temple 1. This practice originates from a legend about Emon Saburo, a wealthy man from the Heian period, who traveled the pilgrimage route in reverse order to meet Kobo Daishi and finally succeeded. Since that year was said to be a leap year, it is believed that performing the reverse pilgrimage in a leap year brings greater spiritual benefits.

          <p>
            You don't necessarily need to visit all the temples at once. While visiting all temples in one continuous journey is called "toshi-uchi," the more common method is "kugiri-uchi," where you divide the pilgrimage into several trips according to your time and physical condition. It's important to proceed at your own pace without overexertion.

            There are no strict requirements, but wearing white clothing (hakue) and a sedge hat (suge-gasa) helps you feel more focused and makes you easily recognizable as a pilgrim. Functional, comfortable clothing is also acceptable, but even in casual wear, simply wearing a wagesa (small prayer stole) around your neck shows proper respect for worship.

            Shukubo is a lodging facility attached to temples for worshippers and pilgrims. The appeal lies in being able to participate in early morning prayer services and enjoy vegetarian temple cuisine, providing unique experiences specific to each temple. In recent years, many shukubo have become accessible to general tourists as well.

            There is no mandatory requirement to visit Koyasan. While it is considered polite etiquette to make a thanksgiving visit to Okunoin at Koyasan to report the completion of the pilgrimage and express gratitude, some people choose to make their thanksgiving visit to Ryozenji (Temple 1) instead, and others head straight home after completing the pilgrimage. You should decide based on your own feelings and circumstances.

            It depends on the type of commemorative project and items. For example, commemorative cards from the "Kobo Daishi 1250th Birthday Anniversary Project" are planned to be available for purchase at the Shikoku 88 Sacred Places Association office after the project ends, as long as supplies last. However, commemorative stamps and similar items are only available during the project period. Please contact the Shikoku 88 Sacred Places Association for details.

            Yes, anyone can visit regardless of religious sect or denomination. The 88 temples of Shikoku include temples from various Buddhist sects, not just Shingon. Many people undertake the pilgrimage without strong religious faith, simply to experience Japanese culture.

            Walking pilgrimage (aruki-henro) is the most traditional method, but today you can choose from various means according to your physical condition, time, and budget. Options include car pilgrimage using your own vehicle or rental car, bus tours, bicycle, and public transportation.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            "Nokyo" is received as proof of offering sutras and has a strong meaning as spiritual practice. On the other hand, "goshuin" is received as proof of worship and can be considered a more widely popularized form of nokyo. In the Shikoku pilgrimage, it is called "nokyo" because sutras are offered.

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            This is because there is a custom in the Shikoku pilgrimage called "kasane-in" (layered stamps), where the same nokyo-cho is used for multiple pilgrimages. If dates were written the first time, it would cause inconvenience for subsequent visits, so it has become customary to deliberately not include dates.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Each character written on the hat has its own meaning. The Sanskrit character on the front represents Kobo Daishi, and "Dogyo Ninin" (Two Companions on the Path) means always being together with Daishi-sama. The four verses written around it, such as "Meiko Sangai-jo...," are Buddhist teachings that show the path to enlightenment.

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            This is because there is a belief that Kobo Daishi (Daishi-sama) is an incarnation of Maitreya Bodhisattva or inherits his teachings. Additionally, it is believed that Daishi-sama continues meditation at Koyasan and will appear with Maitreya Bodhisattva after 5.67 billion years to save people. Due to this deep relationship, the same Sanskrit character "Yu" is used.

            Service animals such as guide dogs and assistance dogs can basically accompany visitors for worship. For general pets, policies vary by temple. Even if the temple grounds are allowed, entry to the main hall or Daishi hall is often restricted. Always contact the temple directly in advance and observe proper etiquette during your visit.
